Title: Coding Quiz

Description:
In this assignment the task was to create a multiple choice quiz from scratch. I was quite proficient in the earlier stages of the process, having no trouble structuring the 
html and laying out the css, however, the challenges began to arise an hour into working in the javascript file. It took me quite a while to wrap my head around how I would code the buttons so
that selecting the correct answer would register accordingly. Eventually, I devised a solution using a combination of notes from the module as well as my own logic. There were also
a couple other bugs that I did not have enough to time fully fix such as the leaderboard not displaying the user's name and score despite it being collected in the local
storage. Overall, working on this assignment taught me a few things, the most notable being to set myself up for success by starting to work on the project sooner rather than later
as with coding there is gauranteed to be several issues that will slow down your progress.
